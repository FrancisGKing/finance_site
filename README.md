This project was made as part of Harvard's CS50 Edx course. It allows users to get quotes on stocks, buy shares of stocks, and sell shares of stocks they own shares off. Users can also see their complete transaction history. The codebase for this site was written in python, using flask as the web framework. The database uses SQLite, and the frontend is written using the Jinja templating language and the Bootstrap library. You can see a live version of the site here.
